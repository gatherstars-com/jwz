image:clonobg.png[Gather Stars Logo, 100, 100] This visualize tool is a working example showing how to use the
Gather Stars, Inc. version of the widely known JWZ message threading algorithm originally written by
Jamie Zawinsky - see https://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html[his explanation here].

This example is fairly bare bones for clarity- for instance I did not implement doubly linked lists or use containers,
but the example uses the go interfaces of the actual package, which means that you can implement the interface to your
email inputs however you like. In other words in a production class use. The package is advertised as production
quality, but the examples are obviously not.

== Following the example code

.The code is easy enough, with the main.go file showing how to:
* Parse raw .eml files in to email envelopes using the excellent https://github.com/jhillyerd/enmime[Enmime go module]
* Wrap the parsed envelopes in to a set of Threadable interfaces
* Thread the set using the jwz package
* Use the https://github.com/rivo/tview[tview] package to create an ASCII display tree of the emails to show humans that
  threading is working. The package tests verify it is working for programs.

.The handlers.go file provides:
* Sample implementations of the interface(s) you need to implement to use the algorithm/pkg
* A couple of utility funcs, including sorting the threaded tree by date
  footnote:[If I have time, I will implement sort as an interface - maybe someone else would like to?]

== Trying it out

The repo provides a publicly available email set under test/testdata. Install the visualize command and then
run it like this:

====
 $ vizualize -emldir path/to/test/testdata
====

You will se a few diagnostics about the quality of the test set (it is deliberately broken in some places for the
unit tests), you should see a treeview in your terminal that looks like this:
